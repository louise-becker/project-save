# Final Project - Save

I want to create a web application where users can log in and take a quiz to know how much time or money they could save in their life (ie the quiz is about how much time or money they spend at the moment on basics - cleaning, grocery shopping, commuting, buying furniture). They will then be directed to a result page where the information is displayed and then there is a list of suppliers that they can chose from to execute the “save”. Additional idea is to have a result page about how one can minimize carbon footprint but this wont be linked to a quiz. Stretch goal would be that the list of suppliers and the possible time/money save could be send by email. I am also very interested by headless CMS and would love to check that out somehow.
